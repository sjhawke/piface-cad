# piface-cad

My mucking around area with code to work with the PiFace Control and Display modules on the Raspberry Pi Model B.

This should work out of the box with the latest Raspbian distro, plus the PiFace CAD tools from here:

** Warning ** 

Python is not my language of choice professionally and the code may not be either elegant nor efficient.

Comments are welcome.
